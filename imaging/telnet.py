"""
TelnetProxy is what controls the telnet connection to the node,
it is subclassed as Frisbee and ImageZip

As per the design of telnetlib3, it uses a couple helper classes
* the shell (telnetlib3.TerminalShell) is what receives the session's output,
  so we have for example a FrisbeeParser class that acts as such a shell
* a client (telnetlib3.TelnetClient); 
  that we specialize so we can propagate our own stuff
  (the telnetproxy instance primarily) down to FrisbeeParser

This class essentially is subclassed as classes Frisbee and ImageZip  
"""

# in our usage model it would be more convenient to define this when the command is run
